# G-CD-Final-Assignment
This repo contains my script for the final assignment on the getting and cleaning data course

For this analysis I used the given data to finally get to a clean and tidy summary of the means of all the relevant variables grouped by the six activities in the test

- run_analysis is the R code that did all the work
- result.txt is the final dataset
- Codebook.txt is the codebook of the process
