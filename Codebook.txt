Data used for this analysis was originally downloaded from UCI HAR Dataset 
URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Original Variables: features <- features.txt Correspond to the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axual raw signals activities 
- activity_labels.txt List of activities that correspond to actions performed during measurements, as well as its codes subject_test 
- subject_test.txt subject_train 
- subject_train.txt x_test 
- x_test.txt y_test 
- y_test.txt x_train 
- x_train.txt y_train 
- y_train.txt

Own Variables:
data = merge of x_train and x_test 
labels = merge of y_train and y_test 
data = Extract of data by regarding only to mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Name replacement: Words starting with tBody replaced with Body
		  Words starting with tGravityreplaced with Gravity
		  Words starting with fBody replaced with Fourier
		  Acc and Gyro were repleced by accelerometer an gyroscope respectively
